{phang}{cmd:aweight}s and {cmd:fweight}s are allowed (see help {help weights:weights}).  {help fvvarlist: Factor} and {help tsvarlist:time series variables} are not allowed.  Use the {help xi} prefix for factor variables.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:mvdom} sets the data up in a way to allow for the dominance analysis of a multivariate regression by utilizing {help canon}ical correlation. The default metric used is the Rxy metric described by Azen and Budescu (2006). 

{pstd}
{cmd:mvdom} uses the first variable in the {it:varlist} as the first dependent variable in the multivariate regression.  All other variables in the {it:varlist} are used as independent variables.  All dependent variables after the first are entered into the regression in the {opt dvs()} option. {cmd:domin} will only show the first dependent variable in the output.

{pstd}
{cmd:mvdom} is intended for use only as a wrapper program with {cmd:domin} for the dominance analysis of multivariate linear regression, and its syntax is designed to conform with {cmd:domin}'s expectations. 
It is not recommended for use as an estimation command outside of {cmd:domin}.

{title:Options}

{phang}{opt dvs(depvar2 [... depvar_r])} specifies the second through {it:r}th other dependent variables to be used in the multivariate regression. Note the first dependent variable, depvar1, as shown in the syntax. dvs() is required.

{phang}{opt pxy} changes the fit statistic from the default "symmetric" {it:Rxy} to the "nonsymmetric" {it:Pxy} model fit statistic. Both fit statistics are described by Azen and Budescu (2006).

{phang}{opt epsilon} changes the decomposition estimation method to relative weights estimation method described by LeBreton & Tonidandel (2008). The {opt epsilon} method produces a decomposition of the {it:Pxy} statistic.

{title:Saved results}

{phang}{cmd:mvdom} saves the following results to {cmd: e()}:
